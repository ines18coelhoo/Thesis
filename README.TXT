The Thesis-MSC LaTeX template can be used for Instituto Superior Técnico Master of Science thesis of DEI (or other departments), as it follows the regulations published by the Scientific Council of IST.

To start using, just open and modify your data in the following files:

1. Thesis-MSc-Preamble_commands.tex
Select the ‘main’ language of your thesis in the line that loads the package ‘babel’:
line.22
	\usepackage[main=english,portuguese]{babel}	
	or 
	\usepackage[english,main=portuguese]{babel}
	
The thesis document will then "auto-magically" modify all the adequate keywords, titles, captions, etc. according to the selected language.

Later, you may modify parameters or include other LaTeX packages if deemed necessary.

To deliver a PDF version without annotations/todonotes and Track Changes, you need to modify the options as follows:

For TODO Notes, the following lines:
line.118/119
    % use the line with the 'disable' option for the TODO Notes
    \usepackage[textwidth=2cm, textsize=small, disable]{todonotes}
 
For Track Changes, the following lines: 
line.127/128
    % use the line with the 'final' option for the Track Changes
    \usepackage[authormarkup=superscript,authormarkuptext=id,markup=underlined,ulem={ULforem,normalbf},final]{changes}




2. Thesis-MSc-Front_Cover.tex
In this document insert your data (your full name, thesis titles, supervisors names, date, degree, etc.):

	\title{}
	\subtitle{}
	\author{}
	\degree{}
	\supervisor{}
	\othersupervisor{}
	\date{}

For Tracking changes, you can also replace the id of the collaborators, in the lines 55-57:

    \definechangesauthor[color=colorname]{id}

For a DRAFT version of the thesis (before examination) select (comment/uncomment) the following command to the value ‘false’ (in lines 63/64):

	\finalthesis{false}

If it is for the final version (approved after examination) then select (comment/uncomment) the command to the value ‘true’ (in lines 63/64):

	\finalthesis{true}

and include the full names of all the members of the Examination Committee (except the Supervisor):

	\chairperson{} (the President of the Committee, after approval)
	\vogalone{} (its is normally the only committee member)
	\vogaltwo{} (normally not used)
	\vogalthree{} (normally not used)

3. The content of your thesis will be written in the documents in folder ‘Chapters’
Do not modify the ‘header’ in all those documents, except the name of the document as it contains compilation directives.
 
If you need to add more Chapters, just create new .tex documents and add the header.
If you do not need that many Chapters in your thesis, just comment the lines in the main document:

  	‘Thesis-MSc-Main_Document.tex’

For example, if you do not need a 6th Chapter, comment the following lines:

	%Chapter 6
	\input{./Chapters/Thesis-MSc-Chapter_6.tex}
	% If Printing on DOUBLE SIDED pages, the second page should be white.
	% Otherwise, comment the following command:
	\cleardoublepage

4. Thesis-MSc-Bibliography.bib
This file is the default Bibliography database. 
If you are using Mendeley.com as Reference Manager, you can "link" the .bib file to your account in that service in order to keep the data automatically synchronized.
For those purposes, replace that file with your own file (generated by Mendeley app locally), and if the name is different, just modify the corresponding line in in the main document ‘Thesis-MSc-Main_Document.tex’:

	\bibliography{./Thesis-MSc-Bibliography}


5. If you do not want a Thesis Logo (picture) in the cover just comment line 18 of Thesis-MSc-Front_Cover.tex
